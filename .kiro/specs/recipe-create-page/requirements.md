# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a comprehensive recipe creation interface that guides users through a multi-step process to create detailed recipes. The interface uses a tabbed/step-based approach to organize the recipe creation process into logical sections: basic information, categorization and ingredients, cooking instructions, and nutritional information. Users can navigate between steps freely, allowing them to edit and refine their recipe before final submission.
